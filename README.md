repo for itc134 assignment 8 -- lamp stack script

After doing some reasearch, I decided to install the LAMP stack in the same way that we did in class.
I found a tutorial called "How to install Linux, Apache, MySql and PHP (LAMP) stack on Ubuntu" and it 
went through basically the same process as we did in class.
