repo for itc134 assignment 8 -- lamp stack script

After doing some reasearch, I decided to install the LAMP stack in the same way that we did in class.
I found a tutorial called "How to install Linux, Apache, MySql and PHP (LAMP) stack on Ubuntu" and it 
went through basically the same process as we did in class. For the scope of this application, I didn't 
feel that I needed anything more than that, so I stuck with our script, but I came across a few articles 
in the course of my research that I am including in my documentation because I did read them in the 
process of making the decision to go with what we did.
